# To do
- Selectable config
- Replace SaveDialog by Treeview for directories
- Wiki documentation

## Delayed
- Add information when restoring (restic didn't give information for now, but in progress : https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3413#event-9556227439) 

## Done
- ~~For local repo, show real used space~~
- ~~Add repo migration to V2 for using compression~~
- ~~Command line options : for config location, for help~~
- ~~Add cache for summary when no action made in submenu~~
- ~~Adding extra parameters in setup form for pass to restic~~
- 
# Ideas 
- Clipboard use
- Cached summary
- Export database and save it in repository (mssql, mysql)
- Create planned backup 
    - cron on linux
    - Task scheduler on Windows
