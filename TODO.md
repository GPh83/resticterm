# To do
- Selectable config
- Replace SaveDialog by Treeview for directories
- Wiki documentation
- Adding extra parameters in setup form for pass to restic
- Command line options :
  - for config location
  - for help

## Delayed
- Add information when restoring (restic didn't give information for now, but in progress : https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3413#event-9556227439) 

## Done
- ~~For local repo, show real used space~~
- ~~Add repo migration to V2 for using compression~~

# Ideas

    - cron on linux
    - Task scheduler on Windows
