# To do

- Selectable config
- Replace SaveDialog by Treeview for directories
- ~~For local repo, show real used space~~
- Wiki documentation
- ~~Add repo migration to V2 for using compression~~

## Delayed
- Add information when restoring (restic didn't give information for now)

# Ideas 
- Clipboard use
- Cached summary
- Export database and save it in repository (mssql, mysql)
- Create planned backup 
    - cron on linux
    - Task scheduler on Windows
